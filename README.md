# A-Seach-Algorithm
Implementation of A* Search Algorithm for finding least cost path between two nodes in a map.

The following map has already been coded inside the java file.
(http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgxk/courses/g5aiai/003blindsearches/blind_searches.htm)

There are two parts to using this application:
1) Enter the starting node and destination node.
2) Enter the straightline distance between other nodes and destination node.

Note: This application is only compatible for the map mentioned above. Please use
      nodes from the above map only.
